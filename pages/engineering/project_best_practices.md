Project Documentation Best Practices
===
1. All builds for testing and release must be produced, promoted and accessed [from the build system](buildsys.ratiointeractive.com).

2. Projects must contain a readme with sufficient documentation that the project, with all its dependencies, can be _set up, configured for release and built_. [see Project Setup Documentation](../master/pages/project_setup_documentation.md)  

3. All projects must develop and maintain a release checklist, this checklist must be used by the team for releases.  [see Release Checklist](../master/pages/release_checklists.md)  

4. The repository must be tagged with a message mapping the last commit to the release number and date. [see Versioning for Release](../master/pages/versioning_for_release.md)
