Project Kickoff Meeting
=
The project kickoff meeting is designed to connect the client with the team, communicate how we intend to deliver the project, and determine the current state of requirements (and develop a plan to complete them). The team for this meeting generally would include PM, CRUX Lead, Engineering Lead, Product Strategy. It could also include Architect, other roles as needed.

Three Goals:
-
#### Connect the client to key project team members 
+ Build a sense of connection.
+ Let the client know who will be communicating with them and how.
#### Communicate our process 
+ "This is how we will deliver for you."
+ Sprints, sprint planning, sprint demos, how the backlog works, reports, etc. 
#### Clarify the current state of requirements and the plan to get to sprint one.
+ Review all the data and requirements we have been given. 
+ Clarify / ask questions.
+ Identify whether we have enough to begin sprint planning or more work is needed. 
+ If more work is needed, agree on a plan to get enough of a backlog together for the first sprint. 

notes
-
+ A planning session with the account / delivery / product strategy team is often needed before this kickoff. We need to be aligned as a team to clearly identify the goals and outputs of the Project Kickoff. 
+ It's good to think through the team size for this meeting - only schedule the team you actually need to make communication easier.
