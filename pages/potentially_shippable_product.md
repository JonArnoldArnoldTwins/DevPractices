Potentially Shippable Product

The output of a sprint should be the delivery of value to the client or product. The most common deliverables from a sprint are completed user stories that provide new functionality in the product. However, there are equally valuable forms of deliverables which should not go unmentioned:  
- product strategy/roadmap
- creative brief, art direction, app map, wireframes, style guide, comps
- technical brief, proof of concept work, environment setup

#### The important consideration for all deliverables is that the value be _anticipated, understood and appreciated_. 

- **anticipated** - the client should know what will be delivered at the end of the sprint. This allows clear accountability from the team to the deliverable and date, and ensures the team recognizes and reconciles their current work against the expected output.
- **understood** - the client should understand and believe in the importance of an activity or artifact, if they don't we haven't informed them well enough on how design, development or planning is done.
- **accepted** - the client should verify that the deliverable meets the expectations of what was anticipated and provide feedback. If the client does not provide feedback we may never know we aren't meeting expectations until it becomes a larger issue.
