Initial Planning and Design
=

Often referred to as the _discovery period_, the time before the first sprint starts is used to create a backlog of stories, begin technical spikes to expose feasibility issues and execute on design for the product--both creative and technical. 

### Design the product
Often the team will feel compelled to deliver results as quickly as possible. This should not occur at the expense of good planning; like any other sprint, don't start the first sprint without a sufficient plan. 

### But be quick about it
Endeavor to spend as little time as possible in pre-sprint limbo. If the discovery period lingers on, it sets the precedent of functioning in the vacuum of a clear, measurable plan. The goal of this period of time should be clear -- do only as much work as is required to generate a sufficient backlog so the team can hold a sprint planning meeting and start the first sprint. 

### This is not a sprint
Teams are often tempted to call this discovery time Sprint 0 or even Sprint 1. This can set a bad precedent for the rest of the project because the normal elements of a sprint are not present--specifically sprint planning and a backlog of stories. This can dilute the importance of these disciplines in the view of the team. It should be clear to the team that this is a temporary working state, and that true sprints will begin as soon as possible.
