Estimation
===
Estimation is the synthesis of information and experience for anticipating effort. At a given phase of a project it is appropriate to estimate differently based on the amount of available information. Estimate at the _right levels_ at the _right time_. 

### Levels of Estimation
* **Project** - Estimating at a project level is inherently less accurate than estimating at other levels, and is typically used for high level planning.  
* **Epic** - T-Shirt size estimates serve well for epics, figures should not typically be less than a day or more than 2 weeks. Something less than a few days might be a story, something more than a few weeks might be multiple epics.
* **Story** -   This is the optimal level at which to estimate--stories should have sufficient information to make reasonable assertions about how long the work will take.   
* **Task** - Optional but completely useful. Employed to facilitate thinking through software design and to improve story estimates.

### Planning Poker
This is a consensus based estimation technique that requires several contributors evaluate a story and give estimates simultaneously (independently from others). The unique game like approach makes this a fast and fun exercise.  

How it works:  

* **Present the story**  
     Someone provides a brief explanation of the story, presenting requirements and comps to the group.
* **Question and Answer**  
  Participants ask the presenter for clarifications on requirements or expose unknowns around the story. _If questions don't stop it's an indication that the story is not mature enough to be estimated._
* **Participants estimate**  
     Each participant independently thinks through the requirements and presents their estimate simultaneously--this prevents influencing others' estimates.
* **High/low outliers explain estimate**  
     There will typically be an average estimate, and outliers to that average. Outliers explain to the group what considerations went into their number.
* **Negotiate new number or vote again**  
After discussion, the group or outlier estimators may defending their numbers or acquiesce to an agreed number. It is equally permissible to revote entirely.
