Triage
===
Triage is the process of accepting defects or changes into the development cycle and can occur in real-time or during sprint planning and as a meeting or an ongoing process. This is a component of backlog management and helps ensure available work items are correctly prioritized and have enough information to be actionable. 

### Process Components
+ **QA** verifies it can be reproduced and **sets severity**.  
+ Representative **PM**/Dev/QA reviews issues and **sets priority**.  
+ Issues are accepted into the next sprint _or_...  
  ...made available for self-assignment during the current sprint.

### Assignment Guidelines
+ Assign to QA if ticket is missing information or not reproducible.  
+ Assign to PM if priority is in question or simply to table the issue  .
+ Assign to Dev if it is high enough priority*.  

\* err on the side of self-assignment--this allows contributors to choose appropriate issues.
