Standups
====
#### Attempt to communicate the following in less than 45 seconds:
* What you worked on **yesterday**
* What you are working on **today**
* Current or potential **blockers**

#### Avoid:
* **Story telling** – this is when someone begins a narrative about changes or issues, rather than just stating them
* **Cross talk** – this usually starts when someone asks a question out of turn
* **Silence** – don't expect cues from PM or others to start. If you are paying attention, it will be obvious.

#### Important considerations:
* A standup _shouldn't take more than 15 minutes_
* Quickly determine when an issue needs to be **taken offline**
* _Dismiss people_ as soon as possible
* **Flag issues** for follow-up with a smaller audience

#### Communicate the story
Minimize technical reporting, talk about the _what_ of an issue. It makes it easier to understand the why. Understanding why we are doing something increases the value of the work, and the capacity for us to be invested in what we are doing.

#### Standups should feel fast
It's not that we should speak less or talk faster. We should be able to listen to each person without risk of distraction, move from person to person without moderation and feel impatient when something starts occurring that degrades the pace.

Maintaining pace informs how we go into project work. If people leave the standup feeling a shared intensity, individuals will have more energy, the team will collaborate better and the work will go faster.
