notes
-
+  postmortems should be held as soon after the final delivery as possible so memories are fresh
+  defined as end of engagement
+ can request non-project based facilitator
    + this supports PM participation
+ includes every member that contributed to project
+ facilitation is key, value all voices equally
    +  support people to make "I" statements
         + direct statements about how they were affected
    + knowning they will be supported and not punished by being honest
+ speak on what went well
    + always room for optimizations
+ true value comes from honesty about frustration
+ everyone should say something, doesnt need to be mandatory
    + open discussion vs round robin: requires facilitator ensure everyone participate
    + not open for response at this time
+ entertain themes that emerge, focus discussion around specific themes
    + balance airing frustration with ideation on improvement
+ end of meeting is opportune to praise others for how they helped on the project
+ meeting should end with review of what should be reported and advocated for change/maintenance to the larger company
