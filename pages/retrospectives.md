Sprint Retrospectives
=
Retrospectives are an opportunity to discuss how the sprint went, and what could improve efficiency or mitigate problems for the next sprint. They are similar in nature to postmortems, though they typically typically shorter (:30 min) and only involve the most recent contributors. They occur at the end of the sprint, in between the sprint demonstration and sprint planning meeting. 

### Basic structure
+ temperature test: gather sentiment on how the sprint went, individual contribution, client involvement/support
+ discuss what went well
+ discuss what could be improved
+ identify themes that emerge from comments and focus discussion around correcting or improving on those themes.
