Product Owner/Proxy
=

The product owner (or proxy) is responsible for ensuring the optimal prioritization of stories to accomplish the business objective. This means the product owner must determine the highest value features based on the constraints of timeline and budget represented by the project manager. 

### About proxies
The client is the ultimate product owner, however, they may not be able to serve effectively as the product owner for various reasons: 
- they may not have domain expertise in the product area
- they may be relying on us for strategy on new or existing features
- they might simply not be able to communicate as frequently as the project requires

In this case a team member who understands the client's vision and priorities can make decisions around design direction, feature priority and bug priority on the clients behalf. 

### Product Owner and Project Manager
For the product owner to make the best decisions concerning scope, timeline and budget, they need good information. The project manager should be able to represent the level of effort on remaining planned work.
