Backlog Management
===
The most important component of successful sprint planning is the work that leads up to it. Planning for the next sprint should happen in parallel with the current sprint. Successful sprint planning requires _a backlog with stories_ and a _candidate list of stories_ that are **estimated** and **actionable**. 

Stories can become _sprint candidates_ when they have been accepted by the contributors doing the work. This means reviewing and responding to stories (with questions or concerns) prior to estimating and agreeing to the work.  

Sprint Planning
===

Sprint planning should include planning for all roles, not just development work around stories.  

+ **Review logistics**--when people are out of town, holidays, anything that will affect velocity or team dynamic.
+ **Pick stories for the sprint** from the candidate list by:
  + appropriateness to the development plan, resource composition and client priority.
+ **Confirm with the team** that stories can be completed during the sprint.
+ **Identify completion targets** in the sprint for:
  + design
  + dev
  + test

### Anti-practices
These are things which should not typically occur in a sprint planning meeting:  

+ Creating stories  
+ Gathering requirements or giving initial estimates on stories  
+ Estimating under-developed stories  
+ Debating functionality  

### Guest List
Who should attend the sprint planning meeting? 

+ Generally, it is best that the entire project team attend so they can participate in planning poker and take ownership of (and agree to) the work to be done in the sprint. 
+ Generally, it is best that the product owner / proxy not attend to avoid any confusion or undue influence on the team's decision-making process. Priorities are set by the product owner / proxy before the meeting. The results of sprint planning are reported back to them.
