Defects
==========
Bugs should succinctly summarize an observed flaw or improvement in an application and provide sufficient information and steps to reproduce the issue. 

Basic Structure
---
#### _A subject that summarizes the issue_
**Device:** _Hardware model_  
**Build:**  _Build number_  

**Repro:**  
**1.** _steps_  
**2.** _to_  
**3.** _repro_  

**expected:** _what you expect to see based on comps or requirements_  
**actual:** _what you actually saw_  


Priority + Severity
---
**Priority** is a reflection of how important the issue is to the product. This should be determined by the product owner (or proxy) during a bug triage.  

**Severity** should indicate how problematic and repeatable the issue is and be set when the defect is recorded. Below are basic guidelines for severity:

* **S0** Blocker: Blocks development and/or testing work, production could not run.  
* **S1** Critical: Crashes, loss of data, severe memory leak.
* **S2** Major: Major loss of function.
* **S3** Minor: Minor loss of function, or other problem where easy workaround is present.
* **S4** Trivial: Cosmetic problem like misspelled words or misaligned text.


Example
---
#### _Estimated download time fluctuates wildly as download starts_
**Device:** Nexus 5, Nexus 7  
**Build:**  1.0.1.2  
**1.** navigate to downloads page  
**2.** click to download a file   
**3.** watch the estimated download time  

**expected:** the estimate should not show for 3 seconds and then not change radically  
**actual:** _an estimate shows up immediately, and changes from 0 seconds to over 10 hours, then down to 5 minutes_
